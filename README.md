Programming Languages and Framework:

- <strong>Laravel</strong> is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We’ve already laid the foundation — freeing you to create without sweating the small things.
- <strong>PHP</strong> is an open-source server-side scripting language that many devs use for web development.
- <strong>Tailwinnd CSS</strong> works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.
- <strong>Alpine JS</strong> is a rugged, minimal tool for composing behavior directly in your markup. Think of it like jQuery for the modern web. Plop in a script tag and get going.
